Be respectful of all players, mods and admins. If you have an issue with another player, please bring it to an admin instead of handling it yourself. No stealing, kiting, or otherwise crappy non-PVE behavior.\n\n<RichColor Color=\"0.5,0.9,1,1\">Don't be greedy.</> Clean up after yourself around the map INCLUDING TRAPS. 1-3 Mini VERY SMALL outposts are allowed but only one large base per person. Don't build directly next to other players unless you have direct permission from them. Do NOT block access to any areas with valuable resources/beaver dams/artifacts/explorer notes/anything related to progression. And do not cultivate an excessive amount of dinos.",
